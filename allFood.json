Season the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned.\r\nIn the same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onions, mushrooms, garlic and bouquet garni until lightly browned. Mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring into the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through.\r\nPour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour.\r\nHeat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Then cook for 3 hrs. If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan.\r\nTo make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the rosemary, thyme, bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins.\r\nAfter 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vtqxtu1511784197.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQnr4Z-7rok","strIngredient1":"Goose Fat","strIngredient2":"Beef Shin","strIngredient3":"Bacon","strIngredient4":"Challots","strIngredient5":"Chestnut Mushroom","strIngredient6":"Garlic Clove","strIngredient7":"Bouquet Garni","strIngredient8":"Tomato Puree","strIngredient9":"Red Wine","strIngredient10":"Celeriac","strIngredient11":"Olive Oil","strIngredient12":"Thyme","strIngredient13":"Rosemary","strIngredient14":"Bay Leaf","strIngredient15":"Cardamom","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"3 tsp","strMeasure2":"600g","strMeasure3":"100g ","strMeasure4":"350g","strMeasure5":"250g","strMeasure6":"2 sliced","strMeasure7":"1","strMeasure8":"1 tbs","strMeasure9":"750 ml ","strMeasure10":"600g","strMeasure11":"2 tbs","strMeasure12":"sprigs of fresh","strMeasure13":"sprigs of fresh","strMeasure14":"2","strMeasure15":"4","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/5032/beef-bourguignon","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52812","strMeal":"Beef Brisket Pot Roast","strCategory":"Beef","strArea":"American","strInstructions":"1 Prepare the brisket for cooking: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\r\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\r\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\r\n \r\n2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\r\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\r\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\r\n\r\n3 Sauté the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil.\r\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Sauté, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.\r\n \r\n4 Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven: Preheat the oven to 300°F. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\r\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop.\r\nCover the pot, place the pot in the 300°F oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\r\n \r\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\r\n6 Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\r\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\r\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\r\n8 Slice the meat across the grain: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the \"grain\" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices.\r\nServe with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles or polenta.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ursuup1487348423.jpg","strYoutube":"none","strIngredient1":"Beef Brisket","strIngredient2":"Salt","strIngredient3":"Onion","strIngredient4":"Garlic","strIngredient5":"Thyme","strIngredient6":"Rosemary","strIngredient7":"Bay Leaves","strIngredient8":"beef stock","strIngredient9":"Carrots","strIngredient10":"Mustard","strIngredient11":"Potatoes","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"4-5 pound","strMeasure2":"Dash","strMeasure3":"3","strMeasure4":"5 cloves","strMeasure5":"1 Sprig","strMeasure6":"1 sprig ","strMeasure7":"4","strMeasure8":"2 cups","strMeasure9":"3 Large","strMeasure10":"1 Tbsp","strMeasure11":"4 Mashed","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/beef_brisket_pot_roast/","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52873","strMeal":"Beef Dumpling Stew","strCategory":"Beef","strArea":"British","strInstructions":"Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.\r\n\r\nFor the beef stew, heat the oil and butter in an ovenproof casserole and fry the beef until browned on all sides.\r\n\r\nSprinkle over the flour and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.\r\n\r\nAdd the garlic and all the vegetables and fry for 1-2 minutes.\r\n\r\nStir in the wine, stock and herbs, then add the Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar, to taste.

Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. \r\nBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four.\r\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\r\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\r\nWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\r\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\r\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qtwtss1468572261.jpg","strYoutube":null,"strIngredient1":"olive oil","strIngredient2":"ginger","strIngredient3":"garlic","strIngredient4":"tomatoes","strIngredient5":"lemon juice","strIngredient6":"caster sugar","strIngredient7":"vine leaves","strIngredient8":"fennel bulb","strIngredient9":"lamb mince","strIngredient10":"onion","strIngredient11":"potato","strIngredient12":"basmati rice","strIngredient13":"chopped parsley","strIngredient14":"coriander","strIngredient15":"lemon juice","strIngredient16":"garlic","strIngredient17":"clove","strIngredient18":"cinnamon","strIngredient19":"tomatoes","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"2 tbsp","strMeasure2":"4cm piece finely chopped","strMeasure3":"2 cloves peeled and chopped","strMeasure4":"800g peeled and chopped ","strMeasure5":"2 tbsp","strMeasure6":"1 tsp","strMeasure7":"50","strMeasure8":"1 large","strMeasure9":"400g","strMeasure10":"1 medium","strMeasure11":"1 small peeled and coarsely grated","strMeasure12":"2 tbsp","strMeasure13":"2 tbsp","strMeasure14":"2 tbsp chopped","strMeasure15":"1 tbsp","strMeasure16":"2 cloves","strMeasure17":"½ tsp ground","strMeasure18":"½ tsp ground ","strMeasure19":"2 medium","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/meat/lamb-tomato-and-sweet-spices-shop","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52777","strMeal":"Mediterranean Pasta Salad","strCategory":"Chicken","strArea":"Italian","strInstructions":"Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil\r\nAdd the pasta, stir once and cook for about 10 minutes or as directed on the packet.\r\nMeanwhile, wash the tomatoes and cut into quarters.

To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins – when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.\r\nFor the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above, but don’t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.\r\nTo assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake.\r\nTake 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.\r\nCarefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.\r\nAssemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days. Can be frozen for up to a month.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ywwrsp1511720277.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB41Q7kDZQ0","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Caster Sugar","strIngredient3":"Self-raising Flour","strIngredient4":"Almonds","strIngredient5":"Baking Powder","strIngredient6":"Eggs","strIngredient7":"Vanilla Extract","strIngredient8":"Almond Extract","strIngredient9":"Butter","strIngredient10":"Caster Sugar","strIngredient11":"Self-raising Flour","strIngredient12":"Almonds","strIngredient13":"Baking Powder","strIngredient14":"Eggs","strIngredient15":"Vanilla Extract","strIngredient16":"Almond Extract","strIngredient17":"Pink Food Colouring","strIngredient18":"Apricot","strIngredient19":"Marzipan","strIngredient20":"Icing Sugar","strMeasure1":"175g","strMeasure2":"175g","strMeasure3":"140g","strMeasure4":"50g","strMeasure5":"½ tsp","strMeasure6":"3 Medium","strMeasure7":"½ tsp","strMeasure8":"¼ teaspoon","strMeasure9":"175g","strMeasure10":"175g","strMeasure11":"140g","strMeasure12":"50g","strMeasure13":"½ tsp","strMeasure14":"3 Medium","strMeasure15":"½ tsp","strMeasure16":"¼ teaspoon","strMeasure17":"½ tsp","strMeasure18":"200g","strMeasure19":"1kg","strMeasure20":"Dusting","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1120657/battenberg-cake","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52891","strMeal":"Blackberry Fool","strCategory":"Desert","strArea":"British","strInstructions":"For the biscuits, preheat the oven to 200C/180C (fan)/Gas 6 and line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Scatter the nuts over a baking tray and roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown. Watch them carefully so that they don’t have a chance to burn. Remove from the oven, tip onto a board and leave to cool.\r\nPut the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy. Roughly chop the cooled nuts and add to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the lemon zest, flour and baking powder. Stir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball – you may need to use your hands.\r\nDivide the biscuit dough into 24 even pieces and roll into small balls. Place the balls the prepared baking trays, spaced well apart to allow for spreading.\r\nPress the biscuits to flatten to around 1cm/½in thick. Bake the biscuits, one tray at a time, for 12 minutes or until very pale golden-brown. Leave to cool on the trays. They will be very soft when you take them out of the oven, but will crisp as they cool.\r\nStore in an airtight tin and eat within five days.\r\nFor the fool, rinse the blackberries in a colander to wash away any dust or dirt. Put the blackberries in a non-stick saucepan and sprinkle over the caster sugar.\r\nStir in the lemon juice and heat gently for two minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their juices. Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest.\r\nSimmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy. Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the purée as possible. Leave the purée to cool and discard the seeds. You should end up with around 325ml/11fl oz of purée.\r\nPut the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl – the acidity of the fruit will thicken the cream further, so don’t take it too far.\r\nWhen the purée is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed.

Tip the ingredients into a food processor with 1 /4 tsp salt. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Drizzle 2-3 tsp cold water into the funnel while the blade is running – the mixture should start to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and bring together, kneading briefly into a ball.

Flour the work surface, then unwrap the pastry and roll to a circle the thickness of a £1 coin. Use the pastry to line a deep, 23cm round fluted tin – mine was about 3cm deep. Press the pastry into the corners and up the sides, making sure there are no gaps. Leave 1cm pastry overhanging (save some of the pastry scraps for later). Line with baking parchment (scrunch it up first to make it more pliable) and fill with baking beans. Blind-bake for 15-20 mins until the sides are set, then remove the parchment and beans and return to the oven for 5 mins until golden brown. Trim the pastry so it’s flush with the top of the tin – a small serrated knife is best for this. If there are any cracks, patch them up with the pastry scraps.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, weigh the butter, syrup and sugars into a pan, and add 1 /4 tsp salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 mins. Reduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3.\r\n\r\nBeat the eggs in a bowl.

Pour half the mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover with the remaining filling and chocolate chips. Bake on the middle shelf for 50-55 mins until set.

It is important that you don’t overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky.\r\nOn a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm. Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold, then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.\r\nTo make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.\r\nTo make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it’s just a little thicker than a £1 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place on a baking tray. Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4).\r\nHeat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wtqrqw1511639627.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV0QCJ0GD5w","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Plain Flour","strIngredient3":"Lemon","strIngredient4":"Butter","strIngredient5":"Currants","strIngredient6":"Mixed Peel","strIngredient7":"Muscovado Sugar","strIngredient8":"Cinnamon","strIngredient9":"Ginger","strIngredient10":"Allspice","strIngredient11":"Lemon","strIngredient12":"Eggs","strIngredient13":"Sugar","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"250g","strMeasure2":"350g","strMeasure3":"Juice of 1/2","strMeasure4":"25g","strMeasure5":"200g","strMeasure6":"50g","strMeasure7":"100g ","strMeasure8":"1 tsp ","strMeasure9":"1 tsp ","strMeasure10":"1 tsp ","strMeasure11":"Zest of 1","strMeasure12":"1 beaten","strMeasure13":"spinkling","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/786659/eccles-cakes","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52791","strMeal":"Eton Mess","strCategory":"Desert","strArea":"British","strInstructions":"Purée half the strawberries in a blender.

Reduce oven temperature to fan 90C/conventional 110C/gas 1⁄4 and bake for 25 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools.\r\nCombine the reserved soured cream with the 142ml carton, the sugar and lemon juice for the topping.

Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour.\r\nLay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10-12 mins, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised. Don’t worry about them burning – they won’t – but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the brandy and let it flambé, then set the pears aside.\r\nHeat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out.\r\nWhen the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around.\r\nDrape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon’s guide).

Leave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. Stir in the vanilla extract. Butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.\r\nWhile the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour and milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm.\r\nMeanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream.\r\nRemove the puddings from the oven. Leave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out. You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they’ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce. To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes. Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them. Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn’t smudge (no need to chill).\r\nWhen ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 mins or until the sauce is bubbling.

Put a sieve over a bowl and tip in the fruit and juice.\r\nLine the bowl with cling film and prepare the bread: Line the 1.25-litre basin with cling film as this will help you to turn out the pudding. Overlap two pieces of cling film in the middle of the bowl as it’s easier than trying to get one sheet to stick to all of the curves. Let the edges overhang by about 15cm. Cut the crusts off the bread. Cut 4 pieces of bread in half, a little on an angle, to give 2 lopsided rectangles per piece. Cut 2 slices into 4 triangles each and leave the final piece whole.\r\nBuild the pud: Dip the whole piece of bread into the juice for a few secs just to coat. Push this into the bottom of the basin. Now dip the wonky rectangular pieces one at a time and press around the basin’s sides so that they fit together neatly, alternately placing wide and narrow ends up. If you can’t quite fit the last piece of bread in it doesn’t matter, just trim into a triangle, dip in juice and slot in. Now spoon in the softened fruit, adding the strawberries here and there as you go.\r\nLet flavours mingle then serve: Dip the bread triangles in juice and place on top – trim off overhang with scissors. Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely seal. Put a side plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hrs or overnight.

Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture.\r\nTo make the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil.\r\nOnce melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.\r\nPour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.\r\nRemove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm/½in wide. Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\nEgg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nOnce the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nBake on the pre-heated baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4. If at this stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil.\r\nBake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set.\r\nRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up in the tin.

Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there’s some barely cooked egg left. With the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top. A quick burst of heat will brown the underside.\r\nGrip the handle underneath. Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge. Fold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate – or fold it in half, if that’s easier. For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers. Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze. Serve immediately.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/yvpuuy1511797244.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXPhVYpQLPA","strIngredient1":"Eggs","strIngredient2":"Butter","strIngredient3":"Parmesan","strIngredient4":"Tarragon","strIngredient5":"Parsley","strIngredient6":"Chives","strIngredient7":"Gruyère","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"3","strMeasure2":"2 knobs","strMeasure3":"1 tsp ","strMeasure4":"3 chopped","strMeasure5":"1 tbs chopped","strMeasure6":"1 tbs chopped","strMeasure7":"4 tbs","strMeasure8":"","strMeasure9":"","strMeasure10":"","strMeasure11":"","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1669/ultimate-french-omelette","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52810","strMeal":"Osso Buco alla Milanese","strCategory":"Miscellaneous","strArea":"Italian","strInstructions":"Heat the oven to 300 degrees.\r\nDredging the shanks: pour the flour into a shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely). Season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper. One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. Discard the remaining flour.\r\nBrowning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won’t fit without touching one another, do this in batches. Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit. Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside.\r\nThe aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits. Ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat. When the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrot, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and bay leaf, and stew for another minute or two.\r\nThe braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes. Add the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes.\r\nThe braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat. Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch. Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer. Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees. Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours.\r\nThe gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.)\r\nThe finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata. Return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some.\r\nUsing a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact. The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky. But if they do break apart, don’t worry, the flavor won’t suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.\r\nFinishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes. Taste again for salt and pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata.\r\nPortioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person. If the shanks are gargantuan or you’re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most.\r\nServing: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce – the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone’s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wwuqvt1487345467.jpg","strYoutube":"none","strIngredient1":"Veal","strIngredient2":"Flour","strIngredient3":"Olive Oil","strIngredient4":"Butter","strIngredient5":"Onion","strIngredient6":"Carrot","strIngredient7":"Celery","strIngredient8":"Fennel","strIngredient9":"Garlic","strIngredient10":"Orange Zest","strIngredient11":"Marjoram","strIngredient12":"Bay Leaf","strIngredient13":"Dry White Wine","strIngredient14":"Chicken Stock","strIngredient15":"Tomatoes","strIngredient16":"Parsley","strIngredient17":"Garlic","strIngredient18":"Lemon Zest","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"4 meaty shanks","strMeasure2":"½ cup","strMeasure3":"2 tablespoons ","strMeasure4":"3 tablespoons","strMeasure5":"1 medium chopped into ½-inch pieces","strMeasure6":"1 chopped into ½-inch pieces","strMeasure7":"1 chopped into ½-inch pieces","strMeasure8":"1 bulb chopped into ½-inch pieces","strMeasure9":"3 cloves","strMeasure10":"2 strips","strMeasure11":"1 ½ teaspoons","strMeasure12":"1","strMeasure13":"1 cup","strMeasure14":"½ cup ","strMeasure15":"1 cup chopped with juice","strMeasure16":"2 tablespoons chopped","strMeasure17":"1 teaspoon minced","strMeasure18":"1 teaspoon grated ","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.cookstr.com/Meat/Osso-Buco-alla-Milanese","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52804","strMeal":"Poutine","strCategory":"Miscellaneous","strArea":"Canadian","strInstructions":"Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365°F (185°C).\r\nWarm gravy in saucepan or microwave.\r\nPlace the fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, about 5 minutes.\r\nRemove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.\r\nPlace the fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle the cheese over them.\r\nLadle gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uuyrrx1487327597.jpg","strYoutube":"none","strIngredient1":"Vegetable Oil","strIngredient2":"Beef Gravy","strIngredient3":"Potatoes","strIngredient4":"Cheese Curds","strIngredient5":"","strIngredient6":"","strIngredient7":"","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"Dash","strMeasure2":"1 Can","strMeasure3":"5 thin cut","strMeasure4":"2 cups","strMeasure5":"","strMeasure6":"","strMeasure7":"","strMeasure8":"","strMeasure9":"","strMeasure10":"","strMeasure11":"","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"http://www.food.com/recipe/real-canadian-poutine-113388","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52912","strMeal":"Three-cheese souffles","strCategory":"Miscellaneous","strArea":"French","strInstructions":"Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and butter 4 small (about 200ml) ramekins.

Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the package directions. The pasta should be tender but still chewy.\r\n2. While the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.\r\n3. Drain the pasta in a colander. Place the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat and add the butter. When the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute. Watch carefully so it does not scorch on the bottom of the pan.\r\n4. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into the flour mixture until everything is really well combined. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Then stir in the drained cooked pasta.\r\n5. Line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter. Pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. Coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\nMake the grilled cheese\r\n6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.\r\n7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended.\r\n8. Remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Carefully cut into 8 equal pieces. Each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (You can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.)\r\n9. Spread 3/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. Place half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. Top each with one slice of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (Transfer from the baking sheet by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each. Finish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up.\r\n10. Using a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. Cover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more.\r\n11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Cut the sandwiches in half, if desired, and serve.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xutquv1505330523.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYq31xLj-DY","strIngredient1":"Macaroni","strIngredient2":"Plain Flour","strIngredient3":"Mustard Powder","strIngredient4":"Garlic powder","strIngredient5":"Kosher salt","strIngredient6":"Black pepper","strIngredient7":"Cayenne pepper","strIngredient8":"Butter","strIngredient9":"Whole Milk","strIngredient10":"Heavy Cream","strIngredient11":"Monterey Jack Cheese","strIngredient12":"Butter","strIngredient13":"garlic powder","strIngredient14":"Bread","strIngredient15":"Cheddar Cheese","strIngredient16":"Colby Jack Cheese","strIngredient17":"Butter","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"8 ounces (230 grams)","strMeasure2":"1/3 cup","strMeasure3":"3/4 teaspoon","strMeasure4":"1/2 teaspoon","strMeasure5":"1/2 teaspoon","strMeasure6":"1/2 teaspoon","strMeasure7":"1/8 teaspoon","strMeasure8":"6 tablespoons (85 grams)","strMeasure9":"1 1/2 cups (360 milliliters)","strMeasure10":"1 cup (240 milliliters)","strMeasure11":"1 pound (455 grams) ","strMeasure12":"4 tablespoons (55 grams)","strMeasure13":"1 teaspoon","strMeasure14":"16 slices square","strMeasure15":"8 slices mild","strMeasure16":"8 slices","strMeasure17":"4 tablespoons (55 grams)","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://leitesculinaria.com/103647/recipes-grilled-mac-and-cheese-sandwich.html","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52844","strMeal":"Lasagne","strCategory":"Pasta","strArea":"Italian","strInstructions":"Heat the oil in a large saucepan.

Turn the heat to medium and cook for 6 mins.\r\nUncover and stir to incorporate the dry top layer of pasta. Push the mussels into the pasta so the hinges are buried in the bottom of the dish, and they stand straight up. Arrange the prawns on top, cover tightly and cook for another 6 mins or until the mussels are open, the prawns are pink and the pasta is cooked through. Leave to simmer for another 2-3 mins to cook off most of the remaining liquid (leave a little in the pan to prevent the pasta from sticking together). Allow to sit for 2-3 mins, then squeeze over the lemon juice and arrange the wedges on top. Scatter with parsley before serving.","strMealThumb":"http://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wqqvyq1511179730.jpg","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itsFEc8W468","strIngredient1":"Mussels","strIngredient2":"Prawns","strIngredient3":"Saffron","strIngredient4":"Vermicelli","strIngredient5":"Olive Oil","strIngredient6":"Onions","strIngredient7":"Garlic","strIngredient8":"Paprika","strIngredient9":"Monkfish","strIngredient10":"Baby Squid","strIngredient11":"Fish Stock","strIngredient12":"Tomatoes","strIngredient13":"Lemon","strIngredient14":"Parsley","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"400g","strMeasure2":"8","strMeasure3":"2 pinches","strMeasure4":"350g","strMeasure5":"5 tblsp ","strMeasure6":"1 large","strMeasure7":"3 cloves","strMeasure8":"2 tbs","strMeasure9":"1 tail","strMeasure10":"4","strMeasure11":"650ml","strMeasure12":"2 large","strMeasure13":"Juice of 1","strMeasure14":"Topping","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/seafood-fideua-paella","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52882","strMeal":"Three Fish Pie","strCategory":"Seafood","strArea":"British","strInstructions":"Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 (180C fan).\r\nPut the potatoes into a saucepan of cold salted water.

Pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Apply some oil all over and\r\nkeep it for roasting on an open flame. You can also grill the baingan or roast in the oven. But then you won't get\r\nthe smoky flavor of the baingan. Keep the eggplant turning after a 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenly\r\ncooked. You could also embed some garlic cloves in the baingan and then roast it.\r\n2. Roast the aubergine till its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid\r\neasily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools\r\ndown.\r\n3. You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. This is an optional step.\r\nUse natural charcoal for this method. Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red.\r\n4. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted\r\naubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke.\r\n5. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the\r\ncharcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. The more you do, the more smoky the baingan bharta will\r\nbecome. I just keep for a minute. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is\r\ncooked, just like the way we do for Dal Tadka.\r\n6. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant.\r\n7. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it.\r\n8. In a kadai or pan, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.\r\n9. Saute the onions till translucent. Don't brown them.\r\n10. Add chopped green chilies and saute for a minute.\r\n11. Add the chopped tomatoes and mix it well.\r\n12. Bhuno (saute) the tomatoes till the oil starts separating from the mixture.\r\n13. Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix well.\r\n14. Add the chopped cooked baingan.\r\n15.
